Postman does not allow to export websocket requests, but basically.

connect to localhost:5000 passing a timestamp as parameter. eg

localhost:5000?timestamp=33650928

then send any message on "getTimeseries" topic to start the streaming.. 
The streaming will continue automatically untill you disconnect.
