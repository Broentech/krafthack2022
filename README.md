# Krafthack 2022

This project was initially created by Stian Broen, Luca Petricca and Duo Zhang from Broentech Solutions as a contribution to the 2022 Krafthack event.
It consists of a React frontend application and a Python backend application (containerized).

It was built for running using Firebase and Google Cloud Run.
For authentication, we have Facebook login and Basic login, using Firebase.

## Frontend

* Firstly, make sure you have node installed : https://nodejs.org/en/
* Open a cmd shell, and cd into the frontend folder
* >npm install
* >npm start

Note that the current paths are set up to use our test-deployment, and would have to be changed to refer to a localhost deployment

### Backend

* Install Docker : https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
* Open a cmd shell, and cd into the backend folder
* >docker-compose up -d
